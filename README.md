**Language: Java**  
In this project, i developed an tool that can manage mysql database which named LunaSQL.  

## The motivation of this project:  
When i was in an internship of system maintenance in a manufacturer, many colleagues need to manage the database. However many operation need use commander, the command is difficult for people who don't major in computer science. So i want to develop a tool that can help people manage the database by clicking and understand the database easier.   
LunaSQL's design inspiration comes from the Navicat and Mysql Workbench.   

> **LunaSQL Features**:
>>- Basic management of mysql (CURD). Include a sql editor
>>- Data table    
>>- Fast log management of mysql database. (log query, log setting change)  
>>- Fast database parameters setting, such as buff_size...  
>>- Database optimization   
>>>- embed mysqlslap for the pressure test. (also make UI interface for it)  
>>>- embed [soar](https://github.com/XiaoMi/soar) for sql optimization (rewrite the SQL expression...) also make UI inerface for soar.
